Exercise 1

Q1)

The combination of a small encryption exponent (3) and shor message (m) length
(8) makes this encryption vulnerable to attack by computing the e-th root of
the cipher modulus N which gives the original plain text message.

This attack is possible when len(m) < n^(1/e), in this case the following is
shown to hold true making this exmaple vulnerable:

len(m) < n^(1/e)
8 < n^(1/3)
8^3 < n
512 < n

If the same RSA modulus (N) was used throuhout the organisation TODO


Q2)

The plaintext message is "WELLDONE".
