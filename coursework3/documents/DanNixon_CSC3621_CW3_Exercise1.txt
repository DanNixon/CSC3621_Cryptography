Exercise 1

Q1)

The combination of a small encryption exponent (3) and shor message (m) length
(8) makes this encryption vulnerable to attack by computing the e-th root of
the cipher modulus N which gives the original plain text message.

This attack is possible when len(m) < n^(1/e), i.e. the message will never
"wrap around" the modulus in this case the following is shown to hold true
making this exmaple vulnerable:

m < n^(1/e)
"zzzzzzzz" < n^(1/3)
9090909090909090 < n^(1/3)
9090909090909090^3 < n
~7.5e47 < n
~7.5e47 < ~2.3e79

If the same RSA modulus (N) was used throughout the organisation then it
becomes possible for one user to compute the private decryption exponent for
all other users who share the same modulus.

This is possible by first computing group order of the modulus Phi(N):

e.d = 1 (mod Phi(N))
e.d = 1 + kPhi(N)

Then the private decryption exponent for any other user can be obtained by
computing the modulat inverse of their public encryption exponent:

d = e^-1 (mod Phi(N))


Q2)

The plaintext message is "WELLDONE".


Q3)

Textbook RSA can be enhanced using a hybrid encryption scheme combining
RSA with a symmetric cipher and by padding the plaintext with a given
message structure before encryption.

The security advantages of this are:
- It adds randomness to the ciphertext, eliminating the possibility of a
  chosen plaintext attack
- By means of enforcing a message structure it adds integrity, allowing
  any changes to the ciphertext by an adversory to be obvious to the
  intended recipient
- It enforces a message size such that the message can never be 

Hybrid encryption schemes work by generating a random key which is
encrypted using an asymetric cipher using the public key of the recipient,
this generates one half of the ciphertext. The same random key is then used
as to encrypt the plaintext using a symmetric cipher, this generates the
remaining half of the ciphertext.

Padding works by adding a known structure to the plaintext which is not clearly
visible in the ciphertext, therefore any attempt to mangle the ciphertext will
(after decryption) also change the data in the known structre indictaing to the
recipient that the ciphertext was modified in transit.
