Exercise 2

2a)

x=421183184045396008847949672535189703891596775623386918532288953516218079938085028752886155666620391419813631317167316631819337277694338966865265179264143550762845428781671313603290317056892475467340480506865970

2b)

No solution.

3)

The number N in a linear equation denotes the modulus in which the arithmetic is
performed, i.e. the result of each operation will only ever be in the range [0,
N).

Since solving a linear equation in Zn requires calculating the multiplicative
modular inverse of a, the equation can only be defined over a in (Zn)*.

The equation in question 2b could not be solved as the values of a and N are not
coprime, i.e. gcd(a, N) = 1. This meant that it is not possible to compute the
multiplicative modular inverse of a, required for the expression x = -b . a^-1.
