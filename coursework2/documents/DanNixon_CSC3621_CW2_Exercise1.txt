Exercise 1

2)

The greatest common denominator of x and y is the largest integer that divides
both x and y without remainder.

At the start of an iteration the quotient, q = x / y and remainder r = x % y are
calculated, which can be expressed as x = qy + r.

From this expression it follows that:
- an integer d that divides y and r will also divide x
- an integer d that divides x and y will also divide r

This allows the GCD computation to be split into a smaller problem as: gcd(x, y)
= gcd(y, r)

When a quotient is found that divides both y and r exactly, i.e. r = 0, the GCD
is given by the value of q.

The extended euclidean algorithm adds an extra step where two additional
sequences, s and t are created which use the quotient calculated in the current
iteration to give an expression for r in terms of x and y.

3)

Uses of the Extended Euclidian algorithm include:
- Computing the multiplicative inverses (Zp)* of Zp
- Solving linear equations in Zn
- Expressing gcd(a, b) as integer combination of a and b (BÃ©zout's identity)
