Exercise 3

3)

A secure channel is a means of transmitting data with confidentiality and
integrity. The confidentiality is provided by a symmetric cipher and the
integrity is provided by a Message Authentication Code, both operations require
a separate key for each direction of data transfer (four unique keys in total).

To obtain the four keys required to create a secure channel a key derivation
function is used. This function takes the session key and a salt known to both
parties and generates an expanded key (with a bit length greater than the
session key) using the hashed MAC function (with the salt as the message).

This expanded key is then used to generate four unique keys by generating the
HMAC of an iterator variable which increments for each generated key using the
expended key, essentially creating a pseudo random function generator using the
HMAC function.

4a)

An attacker, Eve, can break the Diffie-Hellman key exchange using a man in the
middle attack in which communication between Alice and Bob takes place through
Eve. This allows Eve to agree on separate keys with both Alice and Bob and
therefore decrypt messages received from Alice, read and possibly modify them
before re-encrypting them with the key agreed with Bob and forwarding them to
Bob without detection, or vice-versa. This is possible due to the fact that the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange does not provide a method of authenticated
themselves (e.g. through the use of a digital signature).
